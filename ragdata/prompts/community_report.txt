One instance of programming language evolution is the introduction of syntactic sugars, which are additional syntax elements that provide alternative, more readable code constructs. However, the process of designing and evolving a programming language has traditionally been guided by anecdotal experiences and intuition. Recent advances in tools and methodologies for mining open-source repositories have enabled developers to make data-driven software engineering decisions. In light of this, this paper proposes an approach for motivating data-driven programming evolution by applying frequent subgraph mining techniques to a large dataset of 166,827,154 open-source Java methods. The dataset is mined by generalizing Java control-flow graphs to capture broad programming language us # Authors:Rafael-Michael Karampatsis, Hlib Babii, Romain Robbes, Charles Sutton, Andrea Janes \n# Affiliations:The University of Edinburgh    Free University of Bozen-Bolzano    Google Research\n # Abstract:Statistical language modeling techniques have successfully been applied to large source code corpora, yielding a variety of new software development tools, such as tools for code suggestion, improving readability, and API migration. A major issue with these techniques is that code introduces new vocabulary at a far higher rate than natural language, as new identifier names proliferate. Both large vocabularies and out-of-vocabulary issues severely affect Neural Language Models (NLMs) of source code, degrading their performance and rendering them unable to scale. In this paper, we address this issue by: 1) studying how various modelling choices impact the resulting vocabulary on a large-scale corpus of 13,362 projects; 2) presenting an open vocabulary  as holistic guidance but were also concerned about the customers acceptance. Furthermore, they stated challenges of implementing sustainability dimensions in the daily business but also suggested solutions like establishing sustainability as a common standard. Our study indicates that carefully structuring requirements engineering along sustainability dimensions can guide development teams towards considering and ensuring software sustainability.    \n # Conference:RE\n # Year:2021 # Authors:Shengbin Xu, Yuan Yao, Feng Xu, Tianxiao Gu, Jingwei Xu, Xiaoxing Ma \n# Affiliations:Nanjing University    TikTok Inc.    \n # Abstract:Machine learning methods have achieved great success in many software engineering tasks. However, as a data-driven paradigm, how would the data quality impact the effectiveness of these methods remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose to explore this problem under the context of just-in-time obsolete comment detection. Specifically, we first conduct data cleaning on the existing benchmark dataset, and empirically observe that with only 0.22% label corrections and even 15.0% fewer data, the existing obsolete comment detection approaches can achieve up to 10.7% accuracy improvement. To further mitigate the data quality issues, we propose an adversarial learning framework to simultaneously estimate the data quality and make the final predictions. Experimental evaluations show that this adversarial learning framework can further # Authors:Mahtab Nejati, Mahmoud Alfadel, Shane McIntosh \n# Affiliations:University of Waterloo\n # Abstract:Build systems automate the integration of source code into executables. Maintaining build systems is known to be challenging. Lax build maintenance can lead to costly build breakages or unexpected software behaviour. Code review is a broadly adopted practice to improve software quality. Yet, little is known about how code review is applied to build specifications.    In this paper, we present the first empirical study of how code review is practiced in the context of build specifications. Through quantitative analysis of 502,931 change sets from the Qt and Eclipse communities, we observe that changes to build specifications are at least two times less likely to be discussed during code review when compared to production and test code changes. A qualitative analysis of 500 change sets reveals that (i) comments on changes to build specifications are more likely to point out defects than rates reported in the literature for production # Authors:Matteo Paltenghi, Michael Pradel \n# Affiliations:University of Stuttgart, Germany    University of Stuttgart\n # Abstract:As quantum computing is becoming increasingly popular, the underlying quantum computing platforms are growing both in ability and complexity. Unfortunately, testing these platforms is challenging due to the relatively small number of existing quantum programs and because of the oracle problem, i.e., a lack of specifications of the expected behavior of programs. This paper presents MorphQ, the first metamorphic testing approach for quantum computing platforms. Our two key contributions are (i) a program generator that creates a large and diverse set of valid (i.e., non-crashing) quantum programs, and (ii) a set of program transformations that exploit quantum-specific metamorphic relationships to alleviate the oracle problem. Evaluating the approach by testing the popular Qiskit platform shows that the approach creates over 8k program pairs within two days, many of which expose crashes. Inspecting the crashes 4%). Results show that testing in R packages does not have good quality; the most common smells are inadequate and obscure unit testing, improper asserts, inexperienced testes and improper test design. Furthermore, skilled developers still face challenges such as time constraints, emphasis on development rather than testing, poor tool documentation and a steep learning curve.    \n # Conference:ICSE\n # Year:2021  use the principles of Prompt Engineering to prompt GPT-3 to generate summaries for training Natural Language Generation (NLG) models for generating SE-specific summaries.

This vulnerability originates from a misconfiguration in common web frameworks, such that naming convention and automatic binding can be exploited by an attacker to craft malicious requests writing confidential resources and (massively) overriding data, that should be read-only and/or confidential. In this paper, we adopt a black-box testing perspective to automatically detect mass assignment vulnerabilities in RESTful APIs. Execution scenarios are generated purely based on the OpenAPI specification, that lists the available operations and their message format. Clustering is used to group similar operations and reveal read-only fields, the latter are candidate for mass assignment. Then, interaction sequences are automatically generated by instantiating abstract testing templates, trying to exploit the potential vulnerabilities. Finally, test cases are run, and their execution is assessed by a specific oracle, # Authors:Adina Deiner, Gordon Fraser \n# Affiliations:University of Passau\n # Abstract:While professional integrated programming environments support developers with advanced debugging functionality, block-based programming environments for young learners often provide no support for debugging at all, thus inhibiting debugging and preventing debugging education. In this paper we introduce NuzzleBug, an extension of the popular block-based programming environment Scratch that provides the missing debugging support. NuzzleBug allows controlling the executions of Scratch programs with classical debugging functionality such as stepping and breakpoints, and it is an omniscient debugger that also allows reverse stepping. To support learners in deriving hypotheses that guide debugging, NuzzleBug is an interrogative debugger that enables to ask questions about executions and provides answers explaining the behavior in question. In order to evaluate NuzzleBug, we survey the opinions of teachers, and study the effects on learners in terms of debugging effectiveness and efficiency. We find that teachers consider NuzzleBug to be useful, and children can  APIs have diverse behaviors, rendering various repair. We propose a learning-based approach, RAPID, that leverages static analysis and machine learning to build a classifier to determine if a compatibility issue has been addressed. Results show that the trained classifier is quite effective by achieving a F1-score of 95.21% and 91.96% in the training stage and the validation stage respectively. With the help of RAPID, our study yields a number of interesting findings, e.g. only 38.4% of the incompatible API uses are actually provided alternative implementation as a fix; the fix ratio for incompatible APIs with Google recommendations is significantly higher than those without recommendations, but Google only provides recommendations for very few APIs; developers find more ways to repair such issues than Google’s recommendations and there is a large room to improve the current status of compatibility issue handling.    \n # Conference:ICSE\n # Year:2020 # Authors:Florian Ege, Matthias Tichy \n# Affiliations:    Ulm University, Germany\n # Abstract:In model-driven software engineering (MDSE), the declarative graph transformation language Henshin transforms instance models represented as graphs by applying a series of basic steps that match and substitute structural patterns on parts of models. These simple transformation rules are then combined in control flow constructs similar to those of imperative programming languages to build more complex transformations.    However, defects in the structure of control flow or in transformation rules might schedule the application of operations incorrectly, thereby causing basic steps to not be applicable at all or produce wrong output. Understanding and fixing these bugs is complicated by the fact that pattern matching in rules is nondeterministic. Moreover, some control flow structures employ a nondeterministic choice of alternatives. This makes it challenging for developers to keep track of all the possible execution paths and interactions between them.    For conventional programming languages, techniques have been developed to execute a # Authors:Michael Langford, Kenneth Chan, Jonathon Fleck, Philip McKinley, Betty H.C.

However, when behavior is learned in a training environment that fails to fully capture real-world phenomena, the response of an LEC to untrained phenomena is uncertain, and therefore cannot be assured as safe. Automated methods are needed for self-assessment and adaptation to decide when learned behavior can be trusted. This work introduces a model-driven approach to manage self-adaptation of a Learning-Enabled System (LES) to account for run-time contexts for which the learned behavior of LECs cannot be trusted. The resulting framework enables an LES to monitor and evaluate goal models at run time to determine whether or not LECs can be expected to meet functional objectives.

While sites like Stack Overflow (SO) contain API examples embedded within their textual descriptions, developers cannot access this API knowledge directly. Instead they need to search for and browse results to select relevant SO posts and then read through individual posts to figure out which answers contain information about the APIs that are relevant to their task. This paper introduces an approach, called Scout, that automatically analyzes search results to extract API signature information. These signatures are used to group and rank examples and allow for a unique API-based presentation that reduces the amount of information the developer needs to consider when looking for API information on the web. This succinct representation enables Scout to be integrated fully within an IDE panel so that developers can search and view API examples without losing context on their development task. Scout also uses  engineering: ChatGPT, GPT-4, and flan-alpaca. Our evaluation indicates that these recently available models can identify emotion categories when given detailed emotions, although they perform worse than the top-rated models. For emotion cause identification, our results indicate that zero-shot LLMs are effective at recognizing the correct emotion cause with a BLEU-2 score of 0.598. To highlight the potential use of these techniques, we conduct a case study of the causes of Frustration in the last year of development of a popular open-source project, revealing several interesting insights.    \n # Conference:ICSE\n # Year:2024
