-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [author, affiliation, programming language, tool, methodology, dataset, technique, issue, framework, approach, conference, year]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is "English". as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into The primary language of the provided text is "English"., just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

# Authors:David OBrien, Robert Dyer, Tien N. Nguyen, Hridesh Rajan \n# Affiliations:Iowa State University    University of Nebraska-Lincoln    University of Texas at Dallas\n # Abstract:Programming languages are essential tools for developers, and their evolution plays a crucial role in supporting the activities of its developers. One instance of programming language evolution is the introduction of syntactic sugars, which are additional syntax elements that provide alternative, more readable code constructs. However, the process of designing and evolving a programming language has traditionally been guided by anecdotal experiences and intuition. Recent advances in tools and methodologies for mining open-source repositories have enabled developers to make data-driven software engineering decisions. In light of this, this paper proposes an approach for motivating data-driven programming evolution by applying frequent subgraph mining techniques to a large dataset of 166,827,154 open-source Java methods. The dataset is mined by generalizing Java control-flow graphs to capture broad programming language us

# Authors:Rafael-Michael Karampatsis, Hlib Babii, Romain Robbes, Charles Sutton, Andrea Janes \n# Affiliations:The University of Edinburgh    Free University of Bozen-Bolzano    Google Research\n # Abstract:Statistical language modeling techniques have successfully been applied to large source code corpora, yielding a variety of new software development tools, such as tools for code suggestion, improving readability, and API migration. A major issue with these techniques is that code introduces new vocabulary at a far higher rate than natural language, as new identifier names proliferate. Both large vocabularies and out-of-vocabulary issues severely affect Neural Language Models (NLMs) of source code, degrading their performance and rendering them unable to scale. In this paper, we address this issue by: 1) studying how various modelling choices impact the resulting vocabulary on a large-scale corpus of 13,362 projects; 2) presenting an open vocabulary
